### Hey there, I'm Gloryness ðŸ‘‹

I like to code, mainly in Python.

I started programming around December 2019 and have accomplished quite alot since then and I am a self-taught learner.

- ðŸŒ± I'm currently learning **py-cord** (a maintained **discord.py** fork) and working with **PIL** (Python Image Libary)!
- ðŸ“« How to contact me: You can contact me by adding me on discord: `Gloryness#0001`.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I mainly play Minecraft (hypixel) and I used to play Among Us (350+ hours playtime) and alot of other singleplayer games!
